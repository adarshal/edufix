As an 11th grader going into 12th grade at Oberoi International School (OGC), pursuing the IB Diploma Programme, Edufix has played a major role in my academic success. With their expert guidance, I’ve consistently scored 7s in my subjects and topped my end-of-year exams. The teaching is concept-focused and incredibly effective—each topic is taught with clarity, supported by plenty of practice resources and help outside class whenever needed. My understanding has deepened, and my confidence has grown thanks to Edufix.

I had studied with Edufix for my JEE preparation from 2018-20. I was always a little scared to give the JEE examination but this training gave me the confidence to attempt all kinds of problems in a conceptual way. They helped me navigate through various problems and strengthened my problem solving skills. Abhishek Sir approached teaching in a very calm manner and was very approachable and has played a huge role in where I am now. This is why I believe that Edufix is the right choice for strengthening your concepts and performing well!

Hey! I'm Kushal Trivedi and I joined Abhishek sir's classes for Maths (/Edufix) in 2022 (12th) for JEE Mains and Advanced. His guidance helped me to deepen and sharpen my understanding about Maths along with intensive practice, paper solving and doubt clearance as well. His personal attention to us added to the good experience as well.

I am currently pursuing Information Technology at IIIT Gwalior and scored 98.98 percentile overall (and 99% in Maths) in 2023 Mains.

My experience was truly enriching! Every topic was explained with great clarity, making learning both fun and engaging. I now feel much more confident in my subjects, and my marks have improved significantly. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to strengthen their academic foundation!"

After my JEE 2017 attempt, I decided to take a drop year, but I was filled with uncertainty and low confidence. Abhishek Sir was instrumental in motivating me to persevere and tackle even the toughest mathematics problems, encouraging me to spend hours understanding each concept instead of giving up. His guidance helped me rebuild my mathematical foundation from scratch and instilled a sense of consistency and discipline in my preparation from day one.

Thanks to Abhishek Sir’s support and teaching, I was able to crack JEE 2018 and secure admission to IIT Bombay with a strong score in mathematics. I am truly grateful for his mentorship, which made all the difference in my journey.
